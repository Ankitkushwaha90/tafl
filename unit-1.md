# Basic Concepts and Automata Theory

## Introduction to Theory of Computation
The **Theory of Computation** studies how efficiently problems can be solved using algorithms. It is broadly divided into three areas:
1. **Automata Theory** – Study of abstract machines and the languages they recognize.
2. **Computability Theory** – Deals with what problems can be solved by algorithms.
3. **Complexity Theory** – Focuses on the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space.

## Basic Terms and Definitions
1. **Alphabet (Σ):** A finite set of symbols (e.g., {0,1}, {a,b,c}).
2. **Symbol:** A single element from an alphabet.
3. **String:** A finite sequence of symbols from an alphabet.
4. **Formal Language:** A set of strings over an alphabet that follows specific rules.

## Finite Automata (FA)
Finite Automata are abstract machines used to recognize patterns within input strings. They are of two types:

### 1. Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)
A **DFA** is a finite state machine where, for each state and input symbol, there is exactly **one transition**.

#### Definition
A DFA is represented as a 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F):
- **Q**: Finite set of states
- **Σ**: Input alphabet
- **δ**: Transition function (Q × Σ → Q)
- **q0**: Initial state (q0 ∈ Q)
- **F**: Set of final states (F ⊆ Q)

#### Acceptability of a String
A string is **accepted** by a DFA if, starting from the initial state and following transitions for each symbol in the string, the automaton reaches a final state.

### 2. Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)
An **NFA** is similar to a DFA but allows multiple transitions for a given input symbol, including transitions to multiple states or no transition at all.

#### Definition
An NFA is also represented as a 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F), where:
- **δ**: Transition function (Q × Σ → P(Q))
  (can move to multiple states for an input)

### Equivalence of DFA and NFA
For every NFA, there exists an equivalent DFA that recognizes the same language. This means NFAs and DFAs have the same computational power, though NFAs may be more concise.

### 3. NFA with ε-Transition
An **NFA-ε** allows transitions that do not consume input symbols (ε-moves). This increases flexibility but does not add computational power beyond a standard NFA.

#### Equivalence of NFA with and without ε-Transition
Any NFA with ε-moves can be converted into an equivalent NFA without ε-moves, and then further converted into a DFA.

## Finite Automata with Output
Unlike standard finite automata (which recognize languages), these machines **produce an output**.

### 1. Moore Machine
A Moore Machine is a 6-tuple (Q, Σ, Δ, δ, λ, q0) where:
- **Q, Σ, δ, q0** are defined as in DFA.
- **Δ**: Output alphabet.
- **λ**: Output function (Q → Δ) (output depends only on the state).

### 2. Mealy Machine
A Mealy Machine is a 6-tuple (Q, Σ, Δ, δ, λ, q0) where:
- **λ**: Output function (Q × Σ → Δ) (output depends on both the state and input symbol).

### Equivalence of Moore and Mealy Machines
Every Mealy Machine has an equivalent Moore Machine and vice versa. Mealy Machines generally have fewer states than Moore Machines.

## Minimization of Finite Automata
Minimization reduces the number of states in a DFA while preserving its language. This is done using:
1. **Equivalent State Elimination** – Merge states that behave identically.
2. **Partitioning Method (Myhill-Nerode Theorem)** – Groups states into distinguishable and indistinguishable sets.

### Conclusion
Automata Theory provides the foundation for understanding computation and designing compilers, lexical analyzers, and pattern recognition systems. The concepts of DFA, NFA, and machine equivalence are crucial for solving computational problems efficiently.
